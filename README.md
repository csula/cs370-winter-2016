## Announcements

### 1/19/2016

* No class today as I am on travel. Lecture notes have been posted.  Hints for homework 1 are also updated.

* Note that homework 1 is due 1/26/2016.  You are encouraged to ask questions on gitter or you can come to my office hours.  I will be available at the Library first floor this Saturday from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.

### 2/1/2016

* Note that I will not be attending class 2/9/2016.  However, Misha will be walking you through an MPI lab.  This lab is not graded but I recommend that you attend class and get the exercise to work.  We will be using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org).  To maximize your experience with Misha, please have these software installed ahead of time.

### 2/16/2016

* [Homework 2](homework2/) has been uploaded.  This is due Saturday 2/27/2016.
