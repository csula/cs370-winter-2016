## Announcements

### 2/29/2016

* All I have an urgent emergency and I cannot make it to class 3/1.  So no exams Tuesday 3/1 and MPI homework can be demoed the following week on 3/8.  

* Assignments 3 and 4 will be posted shortly, they will be relatively simple.

  * Homework 3: is to demonstrate that you can set up a hadoop cluster and running a simple word count on that

  * Homework 4: is to write (modify) a simple hadoop program.

* Since we do not have a final exam during our regularly scheduled final exam time, you can bring your assignments 3 and 4 to that session to demonstrate to me during that time.

* This Thursday 3/3 I will be in the library first floor from 5 to 6 PM.  Please stop by if you need help.  

### 2/16/2016

* [Homework 2](homework2/) has been uploaded.  ~~This is due Saturday 2/27/2016.~~ In class on 3/8.

### 2/1/2016

* Note that I will not be attending class 2/9/2016.  However, Misha will be walking you through an MPI lab.  This lab is not graded but I recommend that you attend class and get the exercise to work.  We will be using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org).  To maximize your experience with Misha, please have these software installed ahead of time.

### 1/19/2016

* No class today as I am on travel. Lecture notes have been posted.  Hints for homework 1 are also updated.

* Note that homework 1 is due 1/26/2016.  You are encouraged to ask questions on gitter or you can come to my office hours.  I will be available at the Library first floor this Saturday from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.
