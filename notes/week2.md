# Lecture 2

We will look at Blaise Barney's [Introduction to Parallel Computing](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/parallel_comp/) notes and materials to be covered will include up to (but not including) `Parallel Computer Memory Architectures`.

There will be a quiz next class on this material.
