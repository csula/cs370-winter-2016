# Homework 4

## Introduction

For this homework, please refer to the [weather](https://github.com/csula/cs-tools/tree/master/vagrant/share/weather) example.

Your assignment is twofold:

1. Get the `run.sh` script to work with the years 1911 - 1920 (no modification is needed)

2. Create `mapper.c` and `reducer.c` and update `run.sh` so that you can run years 1911 - 1920.  Your result must match *exactly* the result from step 1.

Note that you do not need to run this in a cluster mode.
